# The Lore of the King God

## ComputerCraft branch

This branch contains Lua scripts that are meant to run on ComputerCraft.

They're being used on the official server, you can grab'em and use, or
contribute to make the ecosystem more rich.

## Future plans

There is a plan of automating a branch under `computercraft` in order to make
some sort of deploy to the official server's script library (Maybe a set of
mirror discs which will contain readonly versions of those).
